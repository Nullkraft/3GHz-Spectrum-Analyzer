Elements may contain pins, pads, element lines, element arcs,
attributes, and (for older elements) an optional mark.  Note that
element definitions that have the mark coordinates in the element
line, only support pins and pads which use relative coordinates.  The
pin and pad coordinates are relative to the mark.  Element definitions
which do not include the mark coordinates in the element line, may
have a Mark definition in their contents, and only use pin and pad
definitions which use absolute coordinates.

Element [SFlags "Desc" "Name" "Value" MX MY TX TY TDir TScale TSFlags]

  --> SFlags  : Symbolic or numeric flags, for the element as a whole.
  --> NFlags  : Numeric flags, for the element as a whole.
  --> Desc	  : The description of the element.  This is one of the three strings which can be displayed on the screen.
  --> Name	  : The name of the element, usually the reference designator.
  --> Value	  : The value of the element.
  --> MX MY	  : The location of the element's mark.  This is the reference point for placing the element and its pins and pads.
  --> TX TY	  : The upper left corner of the text (one of the three strings).
  --> TDir	  : The relative direction of the text.  0 means left to right for an unrotated element, 1 means up, 2 left, 3 down.
  --> TScale  : Size of the text, as a percentage of the "default" (100 or ~40 mils) size of of the font.
  --> TSFlags : Symbolic or numeric flags, for the text.
  --> TNFlags : Numeric flags, for the text.


Pad [rX1 rY1 rX2 rY2 Thickness Clearance Mask "Name" "Number" SFlags]

  --> rX1 rY1 rX2 rY2 : Coordinates of the endpoints of the pad relative to the element's mark.
						Note that the copper extends beyond these coordinates by half the thickness.
						To make a square or round pad, specify the same coordinate twice.
  --> aX1 aY1 aX2 aY2 : Same, but absolute coordinates of the endpoints of the pad.
  --> Thickness		  : width of the pad.
  --> Clearance		  : add to thickness to get clearance width.
  --> Mask  		  : width of solder mask opening.
  --> Name  		  : name of pin
  --> Number		  : number of pin
  --> SFlags		  : symbolic or numerical flags
  --> NFlags		  : numerical flags only
