 1) Yes, it will need another copper spin for the filter connections, that's true.
Other than that, there was a swap done on two lines that I took care of in the Arduino Software, details below.

2) If you change anything for Direct Port Manipulation, I would appreciate it if we could keep the pins allocated as
they are for compatibility of the many Arduino sketches that I have written and tested.  It should be possible to perform direct port manipulation without changing the pin assignments. If not, please use zero ohm SMT's jumpers to allow compatibility. Use of 0603 or 0805 makes it easy for anyone to do, and we should have ample real estate for this.

 The correct current pin allocation is attached ( Corrected_2A.png ) 
As a note: Timing measurements demonstrated that at 115200 baud, the most of the time is used by PLL settling, not programming. 

3) I have attached the programs that allow FB interface with Arduino in controlling the  MAX2851 chip on PROJECT#3 Signal Generator. One is in FB, the other the compatible Arduino Sketch. It allows Fixed or Stepped "Swept" MAX2851 control for 115200 baud.  
There are no programs yet for FB<>Arduino control for the current Project #1 PCB, only Project #3 .

The ADF4356 FB program and its Arduino Sketch counterpart was done, but that was a while ago, so I will look around for it. That FB program is much more complex, due to Euclid's Equations. There was no FB<>Arduino Sketch program done for the Digital Attenuator. 

4) On LO#2, lines for LD2 and DA2 were swapped. Without changing any traces, we can correct that issue, by re-labeling the stencil, and the schematic to be in agreement with the MAX2871 chip. Like I said, the fix was made in the Arduino Software.
