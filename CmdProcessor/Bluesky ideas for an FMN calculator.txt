A video about Burgi's Numbers (Which lead to logarithm's)

Problem:
To find the values for F, M, and N we find it necessary to loop through
4093 (From 2 to 4095) numbers for M. 

Question:
Is it possible to use a logarithm, or Burgi's numbers to more quickly
find the correct value for M?

What about a binary-space-partition algorithm?
